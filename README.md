Proxl
=====================
Proxl is a web application for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing protein cross-linking mass spectrometry data. It supports data generated by any software pipeline and does not depend on FASTA files created from particular databases.

More Information
------------------
* You can learn more about proxl's features at http://proxl-ms.org/.
* Comprehensive documentation for proxl can be found at http://www.yeastrc.org/proxl_docs/.
* The proxl publication can be found at [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27302480).

Demo Site
---------------
We have set up a demo website to demonstrate many of proxl features. Please visit http://yeastrc.org/proxl_demo/.

Proxl XML and Importing Data
-------------------------------------
To simplify support for as many software pipelines as possible, we have developed a XML specification
dubbed Proxl XML for describing the cross-linking proteomics results from any software pipeline.
Data imported into proxl must first be converted to Proxl XML. To learn more about Proxl XML and the import process,
please visit our [import documentation](http://proxl-web-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/upload_data.html).

Converters for several major protein cross-linking mass spectrometry pipelines have already been developed.
For your convenience, links to the respective importers are provided below. Please be sure to review
the [import documentation](http://proxl-web-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/upload_data.html) for more information.
