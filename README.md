# Proxl
Proxl is a web application for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing protein cross-linking mass spectrometry data.
It supports data generated by any software pipeline and does not depend on FASTA files created from particular
databases.

## More Information
* You can learn more about proxl's features at http://proxl-ms.org/.
* Comprehensive documentation for proxl can be found at http://www.yeastrc.org/proxl_docs/.
* The proxl publications can be found at PubMed
  [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27302480/) and
  [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30525651/).

## Using Proxl
A server has been set up at https://www.yeastrc.org/proxl_public/ for general use. Anyone can make
an account, upload data, and view their cross-linking results. Note that your data are not public
unless you make them public.

## Install Proxl Yourself
You may run your own instance of proxl on your own computer.
Please follow our [installation documentation](https://proxl-web-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/intro.html).

## Demo Site
We have set up a demo website to demonstrate many of proxl features. Please visit http://yeastrc.org/proxl_demo/.

## Proxl XML and Importing Data
To simplify support for as many software pipelines as possible, we have developed a XML specification
dubbed Proxl XML for describing the cross-linking proteomics results from any software pipeline.
Data imported into proxl must first be converted to Proxl XML. To learn more about Proxl XML and the import process,
please visit our [import documentation](http://proxl-web-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/upload_data.html).

Converters for several major protein cross-linking mass spectrometry pipelines have already been developed.
For your convenience, links to the respective importers are provided below. Please be sure to review
the [import documentation](http://proxl-web-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/upload_data.html) for more information.
