 Proxl allows you to combine, compare, and contrast data from different searches--even if those
 searches used different search programs (such as Kojak and pLink) or different versions (or settings) of
 the same program. Each combined data set displays and is filtered on native scores from the
 respective search programs. [Give it a try.](https://yeastrc.org/proxl_public/go?H0DHw08DUM){:target="_blank"}
